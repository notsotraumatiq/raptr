Project Timeframe
Spent about 5-10% of the time I spent on laying out the functionality and designing the componenets (Breaking down the design into smaller design and figuring out the components, determining what I want to render

Spent about 25% - 30% Implementing just the functionaitlies: post request, declaring classes, rendering the state and things to render when the state changes while adding content(paragraph data) keeping tags in mind.

Spent about 30%- 40% implementing styling for each individual components

Spent 10% trying out to incorporate new UI features like the notification panel after you sign up or login or subscribe

Spent the last 10% refactoring, tweaking minor changes and testing to make sure everything works perfectly as it was intended to be.
